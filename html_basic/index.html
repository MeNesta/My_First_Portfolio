    <h1>Welcome to My First Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi! I'm Edward, an aspiring engineer learning web development, design, and
      data skills.
    </p>

    <h3>My Goals</h3>
    <p>
      I aim to become a full-stack developer with strong UI/UX design and data
      analytics skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, Iâ€™m learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL as part of the ALX
      program.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of tech, I enjoy jazz music, creative writing, and exploring how
      technology solves real-world problems.
